# SuperPaint Client

This is the client application meant to be consume by the services provided by the SuperPaint Server application.

The current state of this project is somewhat miserable:

- I did not fully understand what Starling and Feathers had (or did not have) to offer when it came to 2D drawing. It sort of works, but backwards.
- Nothing behaves well.
- The GUI is badly structured and inaccessible.
- Performs poorly in the emulator and even worse on real devices.
- Has almost no features and still managed to get them wrong.

A partial rewrite is necessary to save this project, but this is more or less a complete failure so far.
